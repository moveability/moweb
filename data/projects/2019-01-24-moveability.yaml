description: "Moveability quantifies the extent to which urban structure
accommodates and encourages all forms of active moveability. We quantify
moveability at every single intersection within a city's street network,
starting with the total lengths of moveable streets or ways near that point. For
example, 1km of street with four lanes dedicated to automobiles offers less
walkable length than 1km of separated walking path, and 1km of walking path
offers less cyclable length than 1km of dedicated cycleway. Moveability is also
influenced by the amount of surrounding green space, as well as \"blue space\"
in the form of water bodies.  The above image shows an example of the
walkability of our home city of [MÃ¼nster,
Germany](https://moveability.city/maps/ms).<br><br>Beyond these static views of
current moveability, we also generate layers of \"potential\" moveability
reflecting spatial mismatches between demography and infrastructure. This
potential for moveability need not be directly related to moveability itself,
and the ability to identify areas of high potential yet low actual moveability
translates into a key tool for planning infrastructure changes to enhance
moveability. It immediately enables cities to identify the \"easy targets\"
where the gains are likely to be the greatest."
