description: "Thriving cities require thriving transport systems which enable
and encourage the greatest range and diversity of ways for people to travel
through them. More liveable cities are those in which people can freely choose
the moment they leave their door which mode of transport might best suit their
mood, the weather, or their spontaneous whim. Cities which offer the greatest
possibilities for moveability are thriving, liveable cities. We develop tools not
only to quantify the moveability of cities, but to analyse and predict how that
moveability may change in response to a city's specific visions or plans for its
own more moveable future. See our [example interactive
maps](https://moveability.city/maps/index.html)."
