description: "No two cities have the same data, and not all cities have the same
quality of data. We know what data we need to accurately calculate our various
measures of moveability. Even more importantly, we know how to calculate the
accuracy of those measures. We therefore provide a single measure for each city
of the quality of available data. This measure is a simple percentage (0 to
100) quantifying the likely accuracy of the moveability statistics."
