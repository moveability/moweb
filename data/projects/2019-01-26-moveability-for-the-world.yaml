description: "Most analyses of moveability focus on the relatively data-rich
cities of the Global North. In contrast, we strive to ensure our ability to
develop accurate models for cities beyond this region, and particularly in
cities which may lack the kinds of data generally presumed to be necessary for
detailed analyses of moveability. To do so, we utilise several global-scale data
sets notably including demographic data. We can even calculate moveability for
cities which have no local data at all, by down-scaling from global-scale data
to provide initial estimates before refining these through calibration against
equivalent data sets."
