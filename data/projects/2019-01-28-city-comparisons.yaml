description: "Most analyses of moveability are restricted to a single measure
(such as [walkability](http://walkscore.com) or
[bikeability](https://copenhagenizeindex.eu)), in each case reducing a city to a
single number. Not only do we differ through offering interactive portals to
view the spatial differences in moveability across a city, but we offer a number
of ways of quantifying moveability. Beyond statistics for individual modes (such
as walking or cycling), we also quantify the degree of unmet *potential* for
moveability throughout a city. A city might have a relatively low actual
moveability, yet a very high unmet potential. It is likely to be relatively easy
for such a city to transform itself to enable greater active moveability. In
contrast, a city may have very high moveability, yet very little potential for
future expansion. Increasing active moveability in such a city will likely be
more difficult. Our ability to combine static snapshots of current moveability
with layers of potential moveability translates into a unique ability to compare
cities in ways which reflect their otherwise irreconcilable differences. Some
cities may never be able to construct connected systems of \"bicycle
superhighways\", yet they may nevertheless have large potential cycleability,
and so may respond almost as well through to much simpler changes to street
properties.<br><br>We are working towards a base dataset of sufficient cities to
enable our first global comparison of moveability. Cities will be scored both on
current states and future potential, and our preliminary analyses suggest
resultant rankings will be quite different from what might be expected ..."
