description: "Moveability depends on purpose. I might desire moveability near my
home where I walk a lot, yet not care at all about moveability near my
workplace. Or the other way around. Or I might not ever ride a bike, yet walk
10km per day. Moveability comprises a range of individual layers reflecting a
range of distinct purposes, such as from residential areas to educational
structures, or from commercial structures to public transport infrastructure.
Each of these layers generates its own spatially explicit pattern of
moveability, and each of these layers is also calculated for each mode of
moveability, whether walking, cycling, or whatever mode a city might consider
important.  See our [example interactive
maps](https://moveability.city/maps/index.html)."
